# Black Jack Simulator

##Introduction

This application was built in Ruby and is designed to determine the percentage that you will win, lose, or tie based on a certain playing style of blackjack.  Currently, the playing style is hardcoded in the World class under the method hit_or_stay, so if you want to change the playing style feel free to fork/clone the repo and play around with it yourself.

##The Application

There are 5 classes associated with the application.

Card class: which allows the program to create card objects.
Deck class: creates the 52 card objects associated with a normal deck and stores it in a deck object
Player class:  creates a player object to play the game of Black Jack
Dealer class:  Creates a dealer object to play the game
World class:  where the game actually is played.  This is like a blackjack room.

##Run it

You should see percentages for wins, losses, and ties.
Again you can play around with how the program will play blackjack by going into the World class under the hit_or_stay method and making some changes.
