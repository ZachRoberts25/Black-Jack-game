# Black-Jack-game
Currently, will give you percents of times you win when running it x amount of times.

You can play around with the hit_or_stay method inside the World class to change how the game would react in certain instances.
Currently it is set to how I would play.


Fixes to come:

Aces currently are only 11, need to implement 11 or 1
No double down method
No split method

All coming soon hopefully :)
